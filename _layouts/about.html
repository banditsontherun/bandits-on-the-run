        Bandits on the Run is an indie-folk-pop-americana outfit consisting of three lead singers, a guitar, a cello, a suitcase drum, an accordion, and various toy instruments. They hail from Brooklyn, NY and are known for their vivacious performance style, genre-defying sound, soaring harmonies, and ability to make music-magic happen everywhere from subway platforms to concert halls.

          Bandits on the Run sprang from a chance encounter while busking in NYC's bustling subways, and burst onto the national stage in 2019 when their song, "Love in the Underground," was featured on the <strong>NPR Tiny Desk Contest's Top Shelf</strong>, proclaiming "the band orchestrates a symphony of sound and story through its impressive musicianship and marvelous harmonies." After recording their 2021 EP, <em>Now Is The Time</em>, with producer Ryan Hadlock (Brandi Carlile, The Lumineers) the Bandits took to the screen, devising a short musical film, <em>Band At The End Of The World,</em> commissioned by Prospect Musicals. Since then they have continued to explore the nexus of indie-folk and theatrical storytelling, composing music for the Netflix animated series, <em>Storybots</em>, scoring the movie, <em>The Same Storm</em>, adapting several songs from texts by William Shakespeare for a production of <em>As You Like It</em>, receiving an NEA grant for a new musical with Prospect Theater Company, all the while touring the globe with appearances at the <strong>Cambridge Folk Festival, Floydfest, Summerfest Milwaukee, Americanafest</strong>, <strong>F1 Singapore Grand Prix, Mile of Music, and the Rocky Mountain Folks Festival.</strong> Currently Bandits on the Run are working on the stage musical adaptation of the novel <em>What's Eating Gilbert Grape</em> in association with MCC Theater, alongside actor-musician Christopher Sears and Academy Award Nominee Peter Hedges, who wrote the original book and screenplay.
